# 🌐Tic-Tac-Toe Web App 

A simple and interactive web application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 📄Description  
This project is a front-end web app designed to help you manage tasks / interact with users (or whichever the main goal is). It’s created using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no backend required.  
The goal is to showcase your skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design and (optionally) browser storage.

## 🔎Features  
- Add a new task (or item) with a description  
- Mark items as done/complete  
- Delete items when no longer needed  
- (Optional) Persist data locally using browser `localStorage` so items stay after page refresh  
- Responsive layout: works on desktop, tablet & mobile  
- (Optional extras you might have: filter by status, sort by date, drag & drop, etc.)

## 🔩Built With  
- HTML5 for structure  
- CSS3 for styling (e.g., Flexbox/Grid, media-queries for responsiveness)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and interactivity  
- (Optional) `localStorage` API for persistence
